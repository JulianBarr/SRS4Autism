# Debugging "Sync to Anki" Button

## Why Nothing Happens When You Click "Sync to Anki"

The button might be **disabled** or the **workflow isn't complete**. Here's how to use it:

## ‚úÖ Correct Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Cards
1. Go to **Chat Assistant** tab
2. Type: "Create flashcards about colors"
3. Click **Send**
4. Cards will be generated

### Step 2: Approve Cards
1. Go to **Card Curation** tab
2. Scroll to **Pending Cards** section
3. **Check the boxes** next to cards you want
4. Click **"Approve Selected"** button
5. Cards move to **Approved Cards** section

### Step 3: Sync to Anki
1. In **Card Curation** tab
2. Select **Anki Profile** from dropdown (e.g., "Default")
3. **Check the boxes** next to approved cards
4. Click **"Sync to Anki"** button
5. Cards will be added to Anki!

## Why the Button Might Be Disabled

The "Sync to Anki" button is disabled when:

1. ‚ùå **No cards selected** - You must check the checkboxes
2. ‚ùå **No Anki profile selected** - Choose from the dropdown
3. ‚ùå **Cards not approved** - Must approve cards first

## Check Browser Console

Open browser DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I) and check:

1. **Console tab** - Look for these messages:
   ```
   üîµ Sync to Anki clicked!
   Selected profile: Default
   Selected cards: [...]
   Cards to sync: [...]
   ```

2. **Network tab** - Look for POST to `/anki/sync`

## Test AnkiConnect

### From Terminal:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/anki/test
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "connected",
  "message": "AnkiConnect is running",
  "decks": ["Default", ...]
}
```

### From Python:
```bash
cd anki_integration
python anki_connect.py
```

Should show:
```
‚úÖ Connected to AnkiConnect successfully!
Available decks: [...]
```
